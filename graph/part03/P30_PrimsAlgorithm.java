    Prim’s Algorithm — Definition + Algorithm:

    Prim’s Algorithm is a Greedy algorithm used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected,
    undirected, weighted graph.
    It grows the MST by starting from any node and repeatedly selecting the minimum-weight
    edge that connects a visited node to an unvisited node.
